# Welcome

Welcome to the Spigot-Sounds page!  
This page aims to list all available sounds that can be used in Spigot as a developer.

/// note | Restructured Site
The site received a major restructuring in order to make it more sorted and also add missing sound names in various versions.  
Due to restructuring are versions before 1.9.2 no longer available.

## Pages

Below is a list of all currently documented versions and their sound names.  
Depending on the version can there be more than one sub-page. Should there only be one sub-page does it mean the sounds listed are available throughout all the patch versions covered by this minor version.
