# Welcome
Welcome to the Spigot-Sounds page!  
This page aims to list all available sounds that can be used in Spigot as a developer.

## Page structure
Each page follows the same structure to have it more easy to find sounds being used.

## MC 1.9
Minecraft 1.9 brought major changes to sound names since they are now prefixed with one of the below names to "categorize" them.

| Prefix    | Category                                 |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `AMBIENT` | Ambient/Enviromental sound               |
| `BLOCK`   | Block sounds                             |
| `ENCHANT` | Enchantment sounds                       |
| `ENTITY`  | Entity sounds, including player sounds   |
| `ITEM`    | Item sounds                              |
| `MUSIC`   | The different in-game music              |
| `RECORD`  | The different in-game music from records |
| `UI`      | UI sounds (Clicking menu buttons f.e.)   |
| `WEATHER` | Weather sounds                           |
